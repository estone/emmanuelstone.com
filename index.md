My name is Emmanuel, and I like to build acoustic guitars, ukuleles and that sort of thing.
I was trained in traditional lutherie techniques by Geza Burghardt in Vancouver, Canada. 

Since coming home to Ireland Iâ€™ve been building instruments the old-fashioned way: one at a time, with hand tools, patience and french polish.

I am based near Miltown Malbay in Co. Clare
